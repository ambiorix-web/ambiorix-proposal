# Requirements
<!--
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

**Core Team:**

John Coene and Kennedy Mwavu will be lead the project, leveraging their
extensive experience and contributions to the R ecosystem to ensure successful
execution.

- **John Coene** is the founder of two R consulting companies.
He has delivered numerous talks on R and authored several influential 
R packages, including [echarts4r](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r),
[firebase](https://github.com/JohnCoene/firebase) and 
[waiter](https://github.com/JohnCoene/waiter). John is also the author of the
Ambiorix web framework, which aims to enhance R's capabilities in web development
by providing a more structured and robust framework.

- **Kennedy Mwavu** is a software developer with a strong background in the
insurance industry and over four years of experience in using R for software and
web development. His deep understanding of the R ecosystem and its current
limitations informs his work on improving R's web development tools. Kennedy has
authored several R packages, including [rmon](https://github.com/kennedymwavu/rmon),
a tool for monitoring and auto-reloading R scripts;
[frbs](https://github.com/kennedymwavu/frbs), an R wrapper for Google's Firebase 
Authentication; and
[micromodal](https://github.com/kennedymwavu/micromodal), a package for creating
accessible modals in R Shiny.

**Proposed Structure:**

- A collaborative, agile approach will be adopted, with both team members
contributing to all aspects of the project, though Kennedy Mwavu is expected
to deliver the majority of the work, whilst John, the author of the library is
mainly to serve as support.
- Regular communication and code reviews will ensure efficient knowledge sharing
and quality control.

**Involvement:**

- Both John and Kennedy are fully committed to the success of this project. They
will allocate the necessary time, expertise, and resources to ensure its
successful execution.
- We anticipate active participation from the R community through issue reporting,
feature requests, and potential contributions.
- We also plan to actively seek feedback from other R developers and users. This
will help tailor the framework to the needs of its users and foster a strong
community around it.

## Processes
<!--
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->
- **Agile Development:** We will employ an agile methodology with iterative
development and regular feedback loops. This approach will allow us to rapidly
respond to changes and incorporate user feedback effectively.
- **Open Source Governance:** The project will adhere to open source principles,
including transparent development, collaborative decision-making, and permissive
licensing.
- **Community Engagement:** Regular communication and updates through channels like
GitHub, and social media will be maintained.

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project?

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

- R: Core language for the framework development.
- Git: For version control and collaboration.
- GitHub: For code hosting and issue tracking.
- AWS: For EC2 instance to host example applications.

## Funding
<!--
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

We request a total of USD XXX to cover the following essential components:

- **Personnel Costs:** This will compensate for the time and expertise of
John Coene and Kennedy Mwavu, who will be dedicating significant effort to the
development, coordination, and management of the project.
- **Infrastructure Costs:** This includes the cost of an AWS EC2 instance for
hosting example applications, domain registration, and cloud storage. These
resources are crucial for testing and demonstrating the framework's capabilities
in real-world scenarios.

This funding is designed to ensure the project's success by covering both
human and technical resources necessary for its development and long-term
viability.

## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

The successful execution of this project requires a dedicated core team,
active community involvement, and a well-defined development process. The
requested funding will directly support the critical components of personnel and
infrastructure, enabling us to develop a mature, feature-rich web framework for
R.
