# The Problem
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

While R excels in data analysis and visualization, its web development
ecosystem lags behind other languages. A more traditional, mature &
production-ready web framework is missing, hindering R's adoption for building
complex, scalable web applications.

Shiny offers a specialised solution to design Single Page Applications with a 
reactive back-end. Whilst Plumber focuses on the development of RESTful
Application Programming Interfaces generally returning JSON.
The R programming language and the community could benefit from a
more traditional web framework as found in other languages such as
Django in Python, Laravel in PHP, or Express.js in JavaScript.

These frameworks provide features currently not available in the R ecosystem,
features such as robust routing, advanced templating, and extensive middleware support, 
essential for building production-grade web applications.

This lack of a mature, feature-rich web framework in R contributes to the
perception of R as unsuitable for production environments, stifling innovation
and limiting the potential of R for data-driven web applications.
