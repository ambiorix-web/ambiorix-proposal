# The Problem
<!--
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

While R excels in data analysis and visualization, its web development
ecosystem lags behind other languages. A more traditional, mature &
production-ready web framework is missing, hindering R's adoption for building
complex, scalable web applications.

Existing solutions (most notably Shiny and Plumber), while offering valuable
capabilities, often fall short in comparison to full-fledged frameworks in
languages like Python (Django), PHP (Laravel), and JavaScript (Express.js).

These frameworks provide comprehensive features such as robust routing,
advanced templating, and extensive middleware support, essential for building
production-grade web applications.

This lack of a mature, feature-rich web framework in R contributes to the
perception of R as unsuitable for production environments, stifling innovation
and limiting the potential of R for data-driven web applications.
