# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

Success is achieved when:

- **Enhanced Performance:** Ambiorix's core performance is significantly 
improved, with measurable gains in speed and efficiency, as demonstrated by 
comprehensive benchmarking.
- **Stable Deployment:** A reliable and scalable deployment infrastructure is 
established, successfully hosting multiple example applications that showcase 
Ambiorix's capabilities in diverse scenarios.
- **Rapid App Design Tools:** A suite of tools and packages is developed to 
enable faster app design and setup, improving the ergonomics and speed of 
development without compromising the framework's flexibility. These tools 
should be well-documented and easy to adopt, resulting in a shorter 
time-to-first-app.
- **Community Adoption:** The Ambiorix framework sees a noticeable increase in 
adoption and usage within the R community, reflected by community engagement, 
project contributions, and positive feedback.

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way
-->

We will track progress and measure success through the following indicators:

- **Performance Metrics:** Pre- and post-optimization benchmarks will be 
analyzed to quantify improvements in speed, scalability, and resource 
utilization.
- **User Engagement:** Adoption and user satisfaction will be gauged through 
metrics such as GitHub stars, CRAN downloads, issue reporting, and community 
contributions.
- **Rapid App Design Tools Adoption:** The success of the new tools will be 
measured by their adoption rate, feedback from users, and the number of 
community contributions related to these tools. A reduction in time-to-first-app
and increased satisfaction from developers will be key markers of success.

## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

- **Expanding Use Cases:** Developing additional example applications to cover 
a broader range of use cases, further demonstrating Ambiorix's versatility and 
applicability.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Continuously expanding Ambiorix's feature set based 
on feedback from the community, ensuring it evolves to meet emerging needs and 
technological advancements.
- **Educational Resources:** Creating more educational resources, such as 
tutorials, webinars, and workshops, to further support and grow the Ambiorix 
user base.

## Key risks
<!--
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

### People

- **Core team availability:** The success of the project depends on the 
consistent commitment and availability of both John Coene and Kennedy Mwavu. 
Any disruptions in their availability could delay the project.
- **Community involvement:**  The project's success is also reliant on active 
community contributions and feedback. Insufficient community engagement could 
limit the project's impact.

### Processes

- **Scrope creep:** Managing the project scope will be critical to avoid delays 
and over-allocation of resources. Clear milestones and regular reviews will be 
implemented to keep the project on track.
- **Technical challenges:** Unforeseen technical obstacles, such as complex 
compatibility issues or performance bottlenecks, could require additional time 
and effort to resolve, potentially delaying the project.

### Tooling & Technology

- **Dependency management:** Challenges related to compatibility or updates of 
third-party tools and libraries could arise, requiring careful management to 
prevent disruptions.
- **Infrastructure reliability:**  Potential issues with the AWS EC2 instance or 
other infrastructure components could affect the stability and availability of 
the deployed applications.

### Costs

- **Unexpected expenses:** Unforeseen costs related to infrastructure, tools, or 
services could arise, necessitating careful budget management and contingency 
planning.
- **Budget constraints:** If funding proves insufficient to cover all planned 
activities, certain project components may need to be scaled back or postponed.
