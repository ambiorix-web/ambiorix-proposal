# Success
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->

## Definition of done
<!--
What does success look like?
-->

Success is achieved when:

- Ambiorix's core performance is significantly improved as measured by benchmarks.
- A stable deployment infrastructure is established, hosting multiple example
applications.
- Comprehensive documentation, including a book, is produced and made publicly
available.
- The ambiorix community demonstrates increased adoption and usage.

## Measuring success
<!--
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way
-->

Success will be measured by:

- Performance benchmarks before and after optimization.
- User feedback and adoption metrics for the deployed example applications.
- Completion of the documentation and book.
- Increased GitHub stars, CRAN downloads, and community contributions.

## Future work
<!--
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

- Create additional example applications to showcase diverse use cases.
- Expand ambiorix's feature set based on community feedback and needs.

## Key risks

### People

- Core team availability: Ensuring consistent commitment from both John Coene
and Kennedy Mwavu.
- Community involvement: Relying on sufficient community contributions and
feedback for project success.

### Processes

- Scrope creep: Managing project scope to avoid delays and resource over-allocation.
- Technical challenges: Encountering unforeseen technical obstacles that require
additional time and effort.

### Tooling & Technology

- Dependency issues: Challenges with compatibility or updates of third-party
tools & libraries.
- Infrastructure reliability: Potential issues with the EC2 instance.

### Costs

- Unexpected expenses: Unforeseen costs related to infrastracture, tools or services.
- Budget constraints: Insufficient funding to cover all planned activities.
