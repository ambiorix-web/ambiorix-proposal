# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

The start-up phase has already laid a strong foundation for the project's 
success, with the following tasks completed:

- **Collaboration Platform:** A collaborative environment is in place, including
repositories and communication channels, to facilitate seamless contributions and 
coordination among team members. You can view the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/devOpifex/ambiorix).
- **License Decisions:** The project will operate under a GNU General Public
Licence, ensuring accessibility and encouraging widespread adoption and 
contribution.
- **Reporting Framework:** A structured reporting framework has been established, 
providing clear guidelines for tracking progress, documenting issues, and 
sharing updates with stakeholders.


## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation.

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

- **Month 1-4: Performance Optimization**
    - Implement critical performance optimizations to improve Ambiorix's speed 
      and efficiency.
    - Conduct thorough benchmarking to measure and validate the improvements.

- **Month 4-6: Error Handling & Debugging Enhancements**
    - Enhance the framework's error handling and debugging capabilities, making 
      it more robust and user-friendly.
    - Introduce advanced logging and diagnostic tools to aid in development and 
      troubleshooting.

- **Month 6-7: Infrastructure Setup & Deployment**
    - Set up an AWS EC2 instance to host example applications, showcasing the 
      framework's capabilities in real-world scenarios.
    - Ensure the deployment environment is stable, scalable, and easy to 
      replicate for users.

- **Month 7-8: Documentation Development**
